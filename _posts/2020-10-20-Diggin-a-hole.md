title: Diggin' a hole
---

Eventually, we're planning to build a trellis around part of our deck, and transplant my hops at the base of it. The idea is that the vines will create shade during the hot/bright summer months.

The first stage in this process is to build foundations for the posts that will support the trellis.

1) Dig a 4 ft hole

2) Put one of these Quik-Tubes inside it

3) Fill it with concrete

Repeat for every place a post is needed. (4, in our case.)

More to come on this project next spring!
