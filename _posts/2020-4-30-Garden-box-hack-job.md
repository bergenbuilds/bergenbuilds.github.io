title: Garden box hack job
---

Bergen says these garden boxes are a "hack job" because he made them using leftover scraps and stuff he had laying around, but I think that's precisely what makes it a cool project.

The wood used is a combination of old deck boards from our old deck, and scraps left over from building the new deck. (Unfortunately, I didn't capture details for this blog about the new deck build... but I should have!)

After making the boxes, Bergen stapled some landscaping cloth to the inside.

He attached some small caster wheels to the bottom corners, and that's about it!

On an uneven surface like the flagstones shown here, and especially once I had filled them with dirt, the boxes were quite difficult to move around on the small caster wheels. However, I don't anticipate needing to move them very often now that they're in the spot I wanted, so not a big deal.

If you do want to move your box around a bit more frequently, it's probably better to spring for larger, more durable wheels such as the ones shown here, on one of my other garden boxes. Yes, I have a lot of garden boxes.
