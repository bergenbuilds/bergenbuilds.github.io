At work, I design and build hardware for consumer electronics. At home, I almost always have some kind of improvement project on the go – whether it’s fixing, maintaining, upgrading, installing, or creating – I can always think of something that needs doing. My wife thought it would be interesting to start documenting some of my projects online, so that we can look back on them later and maybe even help others who are thinking of taking on similar tasks.
